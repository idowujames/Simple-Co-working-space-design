# Co‑working Space — Quick CSS Positioning Exercise

A small, focused CSS project designed to solidify understanding of core positioning concepts and how they interact with Flexbox. This is Part of the Scrimba Full Stack Developer course.

## Purpose
This project is a quick exercise that demonstrates:
- CSS positioning modes: `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`
- How positioned elements behave inside normal flow and stacking contexts
- Positioning elements inside a Flexbox container using flex properties and `margin: auto`
